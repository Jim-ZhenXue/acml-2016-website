The ACML 2016 Organizing Committee invites proposals for tutorials to
be held at the 8th Asian Conference on Machine Learning, on Wed 16
Nov, 2016, in Hamilton New Zealand.

The conference aims at providing a leading international forum for
researchers in machine learning and related fields to share their new
results, ideas and discuss emerging topics. Submissions from inside
and outside the Asia-Pacific region are both highly encouraged.

We invite proposals for short tutorials on machine learning and related fields.
Ideally, the tutorial should attract a wide audience, provide a broad coverage
of core research problems in its chosen research area, elucidate technical
solutions, discuss their key insights, and stimulate future work. The tutorial
should be broad enough to provide a basic introduction to the chosen area, but
it should also be deep enough on the most important topics. Presentations that
exclusively focus on the presenter's own work or commercial demonstrations are
strongly discouraged.

Two kinds of proposals are particularly welcomed. Firstly, proposals from young
researchers will be favorably reviewed. Secondly, joint tutorial-workshop
proposals, which share the same topic with a ACML 2016 workshop proposal, are
also highly encouraged.

A proposal should be 2 pages long, plus the presenters' biographies. The total
duration of a tutorial should be approximately 2.5 hours (and added time for
breaks). A tutorial proposal should contain the following:

* Title and abstract suitable for web publicity
* Overview describing the topic
* Relevance and significance of the topic for the machine learning community
* Research areas and prior knowledge required of potential audience
* A brief outline of the tutorial structure showing that the
  tutorial's core content can be covered in 2.5 hours.
* Work distribution in the case of multiple presenters
* Samples of relevant past tutorials and teaching materials
* Description of presentation medium (slides, multimedia,
  demos, etc.) and technical equipment (e.g., internet access)
* A brief academic bio for each proposed presenter, including
  name, email, webpage, research expertise, and list of
  publications in tutorial area.

Proposals and questions should be submitted to Tutorial Co-chairs
