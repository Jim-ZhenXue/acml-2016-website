The 8th Asian Conference on Machine Learning solicits proposals for workshops
to be held in conjunction with the ACML 2016 conference in Hamilton, New
Zealand. The workshops will be held on Wednesday, Nov. 16. The workshops will
provide an excellent opportunity to address a specific machine learning related
topic. We are looking for half-day or full-day workshop proposals.


Important Dates
===============

* Workshop proposal deadline: **May 23, 2016**
* Acceptance notification: **June 6, 2016** (early decision may be considered)
* Workshop submissions due (suggested): **Aug. 31, 2016**
* Workshop author notification (suggested): **Oct. 10, 2016**


Topics of Interest
==================

Potential workshop topics include, but not limited to, all areas of machine
learning, data mining and knowledge discovery, use of statistical methods in
machine learning, and data and information sciences.


Content and Format
==================

The ideal workshop will cover a compelling selection of current and upcoming
research, include an impressive set of speakers and participants with diverse
backgrounds. Research talks, discussion via panels, identification of open
problems, and discussants are all great components to include.


Organization
============

The format, style, and content of accepted workshops are under the control of
the workshop organizers and largely autonomous from the main conference.
Workshops can either be for a full day, up to seven hours long split into
morning and afternoon sessions, or for half a day (about three and a half to
four hours). Workshop organizers are expected to manage the workshop content,
invite experts in the domain, specify the workshop format, be present to
moderate, and maintain a website for the workshop. Workshop registration will
be handled centrally by the main conference.


Duties
======

Organizers of accepted workshops are expected to announce the workshop and
disseminate the call for papers, maintain the workshop website, gather
submissions, conduct the reviewing process and decide upon the final workshop
program. They may also be required to prepare an informal set of workshop
proceedings to be distributed with the registration materials at the main
conference. Workshop organizers may choose to form organizing or program
committees aiming to accomplish these tasks successfully.


Submission Content
==================

Please provide information on the following points:

* Workshop title
* Topic
* Main organizer's email
* Format (half-day or one-day?)
* Organizer and co-organizers info and biodata
* Tentative invited speakers
* Tentative schedule (may include invited talks, paper presentations, posters,
  panel discussions, etc)
* Tentative Website URL
* Workshop history (is this the first edition of the workshop?)


Submission Process
==================

Proposals should be submitted by emailing the answers to the above points to
the chairs: acml2016workshops@waikato.ac.nz


Evaluation
==========

Proposals will be evaluated by the workshop chair and conference organizers.
Young and emerging areas are particularly welcome.
