...general information...

Recordings
----------

All presentations will be recorded in order to make them available later for
public viewing. However, it is possible to opt out. If that should be the
case then please let the session chair know on the day of your presentation.


Poster
------

You are more than welcome to bring your own Poster (A1 is recommended) along
to the conference. However, you can also take the hassle out of travelling
by having the poster printed on campus and simply pick it up when you
register for the conference.
