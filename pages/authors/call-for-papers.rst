The 8th Asian Conference on Machine Learning (ACML 2016) will be held in Hamilton,
New Zealandd, on November 16-18, 2016. The conference aims to provide a leading
international forum for researchers in machine learning and related fields to
share their new ideas, progresses and achievements. Submissions from regions
other than the Asia-Pacific are highly encouraged.

The conference calls for high-quality, original research papers in the theory
and practice of machine learning. The conference also solicits proposals
focusing on frontier research, new ideas and paradigms in machine learning.

The proceedings will be published as a volume of Journal of Machine Learning
Research (JMLR): `Workshop and Conference Proceedings <http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/proceedings/ series>`_. Selected papers
from ACML'2015 will be invited to submit extended journal versions to an 
ACML special issue/section of the Machine Learning Journal.

For questions and suggestions on paper submission, please write to acml2016@waikato.ac.nz
