**Keynote Speakers**
--------------------

`Travelling in space and time <http://somewhere.com/tas.pdf>`_
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Speaker: Dr Who, BBC
++++++++++++++++++++

**Dr Who** rarely travels alone and often brings one or more companions to
share these adventures. His companions are usually humans, as he has found a
fascination with planet Earth. He often finds events that pique his curiosity
as he tries to prevent evil forces from harming innocent people or changing
history, using only his ingenuity and minimal resources, such as his versatile
sonic screwdriver.

Abstract
++++++++

Since the creation of the Doctor Who character by BBC Television in the early
1960s, a myriad of stories have been published about Doctor Who, in different
media: apart from the actual television episodes that continue to be produced
by the BBC, there have also been novels, comics, short stories, audio books,
radio plays, interactive video games, game books, webcasts, DVD extras, and
even stage performances.

**Invited Speakers**
--------------------

`Stuck on Earth <http://somewhere.com/stuck.pdf>`_
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Speaker: Ford Prefect, HHGTTG
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

**Ford Prefect**, arrives, warning Arthur Dent of the end of the world. The two head to a bar, where the locals question Ford's knowledge of the Apocalypse. An alien race, known as Vogons, show up to demolish the planet, and Arthur and Ford manage to get on their ship just before Earth is demolished, where they are forced to listen to Vogon poetry as punishment. Arthur tries to say it is beautiful to avoid being thrown out of an airlock with Ford.

Abstract
++++++++

The novels are described as "a trilogy in five parts", having been described as
a trilogy on the release of the third book, and then a "trilogy in four parts"
on the release of the fourth book. The US edition of the fifth book was
originally released with the legend "The fifth book in the increasingly
inaccurately named Hitchhiker's Trilogy" on the cover. Subsequent re-releases
of the other novels bore the legend "The [first, second, third, fourth] book in
the increasingly inaccurately named Hitchhiker's Trilogy". In addition, the
blurb on the fifth book describes the book as "the book that gives a whole new
meaning to the word 'trilogy'".
