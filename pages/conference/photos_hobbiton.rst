Hobbiton Movie Set, the location of the conference banquet, is an experience to
tantalise your senses, as you find yourself engulfed in the sights, smells,
sounds and tastes of The Shire, at the home of the Hobbits, as featured in The
Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit Trilogies.

The extraordinary following that the movies have amassed has led to the tours
becoming a *must see* while travellers are in New Zealand. The Hobbiton Movie
Set is the only set that remains intact from the trilogies, and that allows
visitors to fully immerse themselves in the wonders of The Shire. You will be
given the once in a lifetime opportunity to see an iconic movie set in its full
glory; from wandering the rambling paths of The Shire, to seeing the submerged
Hobbit Holes that litter the rolling hillsides.

Your guide will then escort you around the set, showing you the intricate
detailing, pointing out the most famous locations and explaining how the movie
magic was made. You will be taken around the 12 acre set; past Hobbit Holes,
the Mill and into the world-famous Green Dragonâ„¢ Inn, where you will be
provided with one of our exclusive Southfarthing beverages, before being
whisked away to enjoy a banquet feast fit for a Hobbit.
