ACML 2016
---------

The 8th Asian Conference on Machine Learning (ACML 2016) will be held in Hamilton,
New Zealand, on November 16-18, 2016. The conference aims to provide a leading
international forum for researchers in machine learning and related fields to
share their new ideas, progresses and achievements. Submissions from regions
other than the Asia-Pacific are also highly encouraged.

The conference calls for high-quality, original research papers in the theory
and practice of machine learning. The conference also solicits proposals
focusing on frontier research, new ideas and paradigms in machine learning.

This year we are running **two publication tracks**: Authors may submit either to
the **conference track**, for which the proceedings will be published as a volume
of Journal of Machine Learning Research (JMLR): `Workshop and Conference
Proceedings <http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/proceedings/>`__ series, or to the
**journal track** for which accepted papers will appear in a special issue of
the `Springer journal Machine Learning <http://www.springer.com/computer/ai/journal/10994>`__.
