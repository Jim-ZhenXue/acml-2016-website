Hamilton (Māori: Kirikiriroa) is the seat and most populous city of the Waikato
Region, in the North Island of New Zealand.

The city encompasses a land area of about 110 km2 (42 sq mi) on the banks of
the Waikato River, and is home to 156,800 people, making it New Zealand's
fourth most-populous city. Hamilton City is part of the wider Hamilton Urban
Area, which also encompasses the nearby towns of Ngaruawahia, Te Awamutu and
Cambridge.

Initially an agricultural service centre, Hamilton now has a growing and
diverse economy and is the third fastest growing urban area in New Zealand
(behind Pukekohe and Auckland). Education and research and development play
an important part in Hamilton's economy, as the city is home to approximately
40,000 tertiary students and 1,000 PhD-qualified scientists.
