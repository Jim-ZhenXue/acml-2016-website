For the camera ready version, you must compile your paper using pdflatex and
the file must use the jmlr class file from
https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/jmlr?lang=en

Alternatively, a template plus the class file can be downloaded as
`ACML2016_Template.zip <http://acml-conf.org/2016/ACML2016_Template.zip>`_.

You can only submit you file and necessary inclusions as a .zip file. Please
make sure that your .zip file contains all sources that are needed to compile
your paper using pdflatex:

* Your main text file named NamePID.tex, where “Name” is the last name of the
  first author, and PID is the paper submission ID,

  * e.g. suppose Tom Chan is the first author of a paper whose ID is 50, then
    the name of the main tex file should be chan50.tex,

* the .bib file, if any,
* any other files required to compile your paper using pdflatex (i.g., figures, other tex files, etc.),
* scanned copy of completed permission to publish form from 
  http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/proceedings/jmlrPublicationForm.pdf.
* Finally, please include the actually compiled pdf file, named as NamePID.pdf.

Please submit through the ACML 2016 submission site
