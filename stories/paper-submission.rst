Papers should be submitted through the ACML 2016 submission site:

https://cmt.research.microsoft.com/ACML2016/.

Each submission should be regarded as an undertaking that, if the paper is
accepted, at least one of the authors must register and attend the conference
to present the work. No-show papers will not be included in the proceedings.

Paper Format
------------

Proceedings will be published as a dedicated volume of the JMLR: `Workshop and
Conference Proceedings <http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/proceedings/>`_ (this is not
equivalent to a regular issue of JMLR).  Therefore, papers should be written in
English and formatted according to their format, detailed below. The maximum
length of papers is 16 pages in this format. Over-length submissions or
submissions without appropriate format will be rejected without review. Paper
submissions should ensure double-blind reviews. Please be sure to remove any
information from your submission that can identify the authors, including
author names, affiliations, self citations and any acknowledgments.

Please download the file `ACML2016_Template.zip
<http://acml-conf.org/2016/ACML2016_Template.zip>`_ for the LaTex template and
style file (the files are extracted from
https://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/jmlr?lang=en - you may
also download and use the entire package from there). Only the LaTex
preparation system is supported to allow publication in the JMLR: Workshop and
Conference Proceedings series.

Policy on Dual Submission
-------------------------

ACML allows concurrent submissions to other venues provided that

1. The concurrent submission is declared to all venues.
2. Permission is given by the author(s) for ACML to coordinate reviewing with
   the other venues.
3. Acceptance to one venue imposes withdrawal from all other venues.

It is also acceptable to submit to ACML 2016 work that has been made available as a technical report (or similar, e.g. in arXiv) as long as the conditions above are satisfied.

Supplementary Material
----------------------

ACML 2016 supports the submission of supplementary material, such as
additional/detailed proofs, source/binary code, videos, or data sets. In
particular, if you make anonymous references in your submitted paper, please
upload the referenced papers so that the reviewers could have a look of them.
Note that you cannot reveal your identity in the supplementary material.

It important to note that the submitted papers must be self-contained.
Reviewers are encouraged, but not obliged to look at the provided supplementary
material. That is, you must not use supplementary material for extending the
length of your paper. If there is any material that you believe is critical to
the evaluation of your paper, you must include them in the submitted paper.

Finally, the supplementary material will not be published or archived by ACML.
If you want to include it in a final version of the accepted paper, you must
put it on a web site and reference the site in the final version of your paper.
